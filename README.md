# Basic Information #

This is a note for *Elementary Differential Geometry* by O'Neil. I will summarize the contents with corrections to typos. I might also write supplementary materials for clarifications if needed.

# Plans #

The original book has 8 sections. 

1. Calculus on Euclidean Space
2. Frame Fields
3. Euclidean Geometry
4. Calculus on a Surface
5. Shape Operators
6. Geometry of Surfaces in ${\mathbb{R}}^{3}$
7. Riemannian Geometry
8. Global Structure of Surfaces

My plan is to include the first 5 chapters. I may write notes for other chapters, but this is not guaranteed. 

# Current Stage #

Chapter 1 finished.
Chapter 2 finished
